# Cloverhound Software Developer Interview Challenge

## Overview
In this repo is a single [`index.html`](./index.html) file with everything you will need.

Your goal is to make a working web page using React to hit the provided API endpoint and display the result.

Please copy this file into a new repo and complete the following tasks.

## Tasks
- Using at least two function components (not including the one provided), create a form with React that will allow a user to enter their name and click a button to submit the form.
- When the form is submitted, use jQuery to make a network request to Agify.io (find the URL structure [here](https://agify.io/documentation#basic-usage)) with the name the user entered.
- Parse the response from the endpoint and display the predicted age of the user.
- Keep track of the predicted ages for each name so you only have to make a request once for each name.
- Make commits however you'd like, but the final version should be on a branch named `final`
- Please reply with a link to your public repo when you are finished.
